2. Task Management Users can add tasks with a title (limited to a maximum of 100 characters). Tasks are displayed in a list view for easy organization. A checkbox is available to mark tasks as completed.
3. Drag-and-Drop Sorting Users can reorder tasks by dragging and dropping them into their preferred sequence.
